## Preparation

You may or may not require some preconfiguration of your machine before the Blockchain Bootcamp on 26 January 2019. We will be using the EOSIO blockchain during the bootcamp and EOSIO requires either Linux, Mac OS X or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Your Machine

### Mac OS X or Linux

You're good to go, no preparation needed ahead of time, we'll see you at the bootcamp!

### Windows

Please [follow the Windows Preparation Guide](windows.md).
