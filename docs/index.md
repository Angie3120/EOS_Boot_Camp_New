## Preparation

You may or may not require some preconfiguration of your machine before following the guided lesson at Blockchain Bootcamp. We will be using the EOSIO blockchain during the bootcamp and EOSIO requires either Linux, Mac OS X, a Virtual Machine or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Step 1: Prepare Your Machine

### Mac OS X or Linux

Please [use a Virtuan Machine](virtual-machine.md).  

**Note: We have removed WSL until standing issues have been addressed**
